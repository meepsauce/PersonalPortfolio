# Gifted Independent Study Overview

It is a pretty cool class, check out the program here:

## Big Idea
In the class, the concept of a big idea acts a passive umbrella of which every sub-project (there are 4) is connected. This does not mean it can be a static concept and throughout the project, it shifted from various topics. Initially I mainly focused on space-things, mostly aeronautical engineering. This was quite sneaky of me because such a subject is super multifaceted and includes subdomains such as mechanical/electrical engineering and control systems (hint hint).

### Evolution
To no one's surprise, my project changed dramatically over time from a space-centered theme to mainly that of control science. There are multiple parities in all of my projects, electrical engineering, physics but one that was starkly independent was control science. It turns out that inanimate satellites and transistors cannot control themselves and there is a entire complicated domain of science dedicated to sensor filtering, control systems and state dedication/prediction. I slowly grew more and more fond of this as the projects progressed, namely how I wrote simulations that processed all the above. This culminated in my action project that was not really tied to space at all, and was a control system testbed. Without a doubt, if I could continue the class next year (maybe senior year...?) I would further research this subject and it remains a primary contender in my big list of nerdy interests.


## The Projects
In GDIS we perused four projects (each roughly 6 weeks long). The last one served as a "action project" and was tasked with demonstrating our knowledge.

I equipped each project with a briefing on why I did the project, and with some context. Additionally each briefing includes generally some criticism and reflection on each project.
