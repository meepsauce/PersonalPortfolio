</p><p>So it turns out that I like control systems. 
</p><p>It also appears that I like rockets/satellites.

</p><p>Rockets and Satellites.
</p><p>
</p><p>I wanted a physical testbed to mess with control systems, and apply everything I had learned from prior projects. Obviously a rocket/satellite was not feasible so I decided to aim for a "Rocket-like" design, one that hopefully wasnt one-use. I settled on a Mono-Copter, a drone that uses one/two propellers for propulsion (and possible roll control) and then 4 vanes that are parellel to the airflow in order to have control authority.

</p><p>
</p><p>Therefore, it remains physically comparable to a rocket, and therefore the control is thusly similar.
</p><p>
</p><p>Going in I knew how to design things in CAD, 3D print them (My own printer was broken, so I used the tools at Decatur Makers), and order other parts from Amazon so I remained fairly excited. I also knew that I would not succeed on the first try, so I aimed to have a "rapid-prototype" development cycle, and the use of 3D printers complimented this desire. This of course meant I had to invest a equally worthy amount of time into the effort, which is where I failed to deliver. I sort of forgot that we have tests... and a bunch of end of year projects.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I finished, but without much of a result. I got one of my prototypes to work for precisely 5 seconds</p>
