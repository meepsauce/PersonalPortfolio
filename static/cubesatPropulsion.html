Therefore, I have always had a glimmer of hope that I could help/work to manufacturer such a device (its a bucket-list item, and yes I am a nerd). Obviously it is without saying that the highschool nor any local amateur groups maintain such programs (hey Georgia Tech if your here hit me up) mostly due to the cost (~100k) related to a project that may just blow up on the pad or last maybe 6 weeks in space. Therefore, I decided that for my independent studies, I would focus on these craft, and as a first project I would focus on the varied propulsion systems that they employ. I found this in particular to be pretty appealing because it combined my love for control science with that of micro-newton forces and of course fancy words like "Coaxial Ionic Hall Thruster".</p><p></p><p>It was fun but I definitely failed to recognize some red-flags while doing this project.</p><p></p><p>A big mistake I made while perusing this topic is a simply went too broad, I failed to really scope in on a specific sub-domain of CubeSat propulsion technologies. Partially this is because I naively thought that the subject would not be as complicated and multi-faceted as it actually was. I was already aware of ion-thrusters and cold-gas thrusters but I never thought that people were using water/ammonia/magnetic gel as a primary propellent in their craft. Additionally, once I found a specific technology, I easily fell into a scholastic trap of papers that simply copied a prior-mentioned novel technology and presented some minor variations that while are worth mentioning, should not have had a dedicated section. </p><p></p><p>All this amounted in my paper turning from a brief overview of various propulsion technologies that concluded in a discussion on which is the "best" (as some variation of a argument was required for the project) to the ultimate guide of propulsion technology for CubeSats with nearly every device I could find.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, I lovingly present my 30 page paper that succeeds as making you a expert on the many, many, many propulsion systems CubeSats employ (and why), and additionally provides "helpful" diagrams that assist with the explanation (mostly helpful for the weird geometries of ion engines).</p><p></p><p><b>Link:</b></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FWuudJC1OTcF0hfW1B46wGfUeG2ItQ2tYo7nr_BhV5o/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FWuudJC1OTcF0hfW1B46wGfUeG2ItQ2tYo7nr_BhV5o/edit?usp=sharing</a>
