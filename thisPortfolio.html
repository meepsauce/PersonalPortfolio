    <p></p><h1>This Portfolio is a Project</h1> <hr><br><h3>Written in NodeJS, this portfolio/blog is statically generated</h3> <hr><br><p></p><p>This website was initally a assignment for Gifted Directed Study but I decided it was about time I made a online archive for all my projects. It would be convienent to do so, and would free space on my hard drive.</p><p></p><p>I hated using tools like Google Sites/Wix and after spending a lot of time on a web application that uses Next.js and React I decided I should try my hand at creating my own site from scratch.</p><p></p><p><b>Potential Problem</b>: </p><p>I have a lot of projects, and I wanted a special page for each project...</p><p></p><p>Writing HTML/JSX sucks, and while I could componentize (new word?) my code so that it is as effcient as possible, it would still suck. However, writing Markdown sucks less so I logically decided to write everything in Markdown then have a generator which converts that into "clean", pretty HTML.</p><p></p><p>Very conviently, one of my little projects from a couple years back was a Markdown -> HTML convertor and so I found the code, cringed and shoved it into a basic filesystem and web server using the classic express package.</p><p></p><p>It is really not that elaborate... the most complicted thing is how I supply minimal meta information for each project so the homepage can sort and orginize each one in a somewhat logical way</p><p></p><p>You can find the <code>code</code> <b>here</b>, its not pretty nor elegant but works well.</p><p></p>
